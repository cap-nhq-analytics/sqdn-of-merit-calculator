\description{
Calculate the strength metric for all units in a Squadron of Merit Listing.
}
\details{
The strength metric is calculated by dividing the starting strength by 12, which assigns 1 point
for the minimum strength as described in CAPR 39-3.

The final result is then standardized using the distribution of the scores to have a mean of 1
and standard deviation of 1.
