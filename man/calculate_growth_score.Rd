\description{
Calculate the growth score for all units in a Squadron of Merit Listing.
}
\details{
The default growth score is calculated by awarding 2 points for every cadet who joins or renews,
giving equal weighting to both recruiting and retention. The \code{focus_area} variable can be used to
change this.

Use \code{recruiting} to award 3 points for every new cadet and 1 point for every renewal.
Use \code{retention} to award 1 point for every new cadet and 3 points for every renewal.

The final result is then standardized using the distribution of the scores to have a mean of 1
and standard deviation of 1.
